# photo-organizer

photo-organizer help you keeping organized the *Camera Uploads*  folder inside your Dropbox account when you have enabled the *Camera Uploads* feature.

## Features

- Automatically detects Dropbox folder path
- Move your photos and videos in a *year_month_day* folder structure
- Do not create a folder when there are only one or two photos in a single day
- Tries to split the photos in *logical* days, with boundaries that are not needed to be exactly at midnight (think at the photos you may take at a party ending after midnight, why split them in two days/folders?)
- Single executable, no dependencies (thanks to [GO](https://golang.org/))
